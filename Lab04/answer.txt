Programming with AWT and Swing is quite similar (similar elements including container/components, and event-handling). However, there are some differences that you need to note:

o Compare the top-level containers in Swing and AWT
o Compare the class name of components in AWT and the corresponding classâ€™s name in Swing
o Compare the event-handling of Swing and AWT applications

The resulting appearances of the applications developed using Swing and AWT might be different as well. Make comparisons.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comparison between AWT and Swing:
 
1. Top-level Containers 
* AWT: Uses heavyweight containers such as Frame, Dialog, and Window, which rely on native GUI components provided by the operating system.
* Swing: Uses lightweight containers prefixed with J (JFrame, JDialog, JWindow), which are entirely rendered using Java for consistent cross-platform UI.

2. Component Class Names
* AWT: Component names are simple with no prefix (e.g., Label, TextField, Button, Panel).
* Swing: Class names are prefixed with J (e.g., JLabel, JTextField, JButton, JPanel) and include advanced components like JTable, JTree, and JTabbedPane.

3. Event-Handling
* AWT: 
	- Uses the java.awt.event package with basic listeners like ActionListener, MouseListener, and WindowListener. 
	- Handling tasks like closing a window often requires using WindowAdapter.
* Swing: 
	- Inherits AWT's event model but supports more specialized and complex interactions (e.g. ListSelectionListener for JList, TableModelListener for JTable). 
	- Swing simplifies tasks like window closing setDefaultCloseOperation().

4. User Interface Appearance 
* AWT: UI appearance depends on the native OS, which can result in inconsistent looks across platforms.
* Swing: Supports multiple Look-and-Feel styles (e.g. Metal, Nimbus, native). Swing allows for deep customization of UI elements like color, font, icon, and borders, offering a more consistent and flexible experience.
