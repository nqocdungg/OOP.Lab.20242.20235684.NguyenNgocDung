- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Yes, Java allows us to do this. We can have multiple constructors with different parameters, which is called constructor overloading. 

- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Java is a Pass by Value programming language. 

- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Because Java passes object references by value. The swap method swaps only the local copies of references, not the original references in the main method. 

- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Because the method modifies the acutal object via its reference. The setTitle(title) call updates the existing object, while the line dvd = new DigitalVideoDisc(oldTitle) creates a new object and assigns it to the local reference dvd, not affecting the original reference (jungleDVD) in main().
